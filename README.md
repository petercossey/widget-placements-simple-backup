This is a proof-of-concept Node.js script that uses the [Get All Placements](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/docs/rest-content/widgets/placement#get-all-placements) endpoint from the Widgets API to request all the widget placements for a store and save the data to JSON files on disk.

To see an example of the widget save files check the examples in the /data directory.
